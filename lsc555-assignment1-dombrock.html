		<h2>System Introduction</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Context: The Department of Defense (DoD) and the various uniformed armed services under the auspices of their Morale, Welfare, and Recreation organizations operate physical libraries on many military installations. The DoD MWR Libraries website is a unified online resource platform for all DoD MWR Library customers and authorized users. The information system provides a centralized hub of all digital resources available to the library users as well as information on physical libraries and links to other MWR and DoD organizational resources. </li>
			<li>Users: The primary targeted users for the system are Department of Defense Service members and their families, however, a full list of authorized users is provided in the table below.<br />
			<table border=1">
				<tr>
					<th>Authorized Patrons Today</th>
				<tr>
					<td>Active duty military (Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Members of the Reserve components and National Guard</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Retired military, including retired from the Reserves and National Guard</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Medal of Honor recipients and veterans with 100% service-connected disabilities</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Eligible family members who are officially sponsored (ID card holder) by authorized patrons in the above categories</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>DOD and Coast Guard civilians, including appropriated and non-appropriated fund employees, when stationed outside the United States; stateside eligibility contingent upon resource availability</td>
				</tr>
			</table>	
			<li>Content: The main content available on the webpage relates to all the digital resources available to DoD library patrons. There are 88 total digital collections available ranging from e-book and audiobook services, digital newspapers and magazines, language and vocational learning resources, academic and research journals, as well as various reference and self-help resources. These resources exist as direct links to the available services. An authorized user must log in with their DoD ID number and date of birth to verify access to the resources. Some resources load through a single sign on function while some resources validate the eligibility for access but require users to create a separate account to access the service. The homepage divides these resources by category into nine subgroups listed in the table below.  A full listing of the resources is available at <a href="https://www.dodmwrlibraries.org/databases">https://www.dodmwrlibraries.org/databases</a></li>
			<li>Additional Content: Through the Locations link in the header of the webpage, users can search for physical library locations and resources. Most library listings include contact information and links to the library specific websites. Additionally, users can access the DoD-wide online catalog from links on the library directory listing page. This catalog is available via direct link at <a href="https://milrec.bibliovation.com/">https://milrec.bibliovation.com/</a>. Users can browse the entire catalog without logging in but must have a separate user ID and password provided by their local physical library to request items.</li>

		<h2>Discussion on the system</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Unique/interesting features the system supports:<br />
			    -The graphical presentation of the website is appealing and the subdivision of digital resources into useable categories seems very user experienced focused<br />
			    -Tapping into the DoD records system to verify eligibility by a unique number that exists on all patrons ID card and using their birthday input as the password is a unique feature not available to other library information systems<br />
			    -Presenting links to other military/government resources of potential interest to the target user population is a convenient way to connect users to services<br />
			    -The implementation of single sign on connection to some of the digital resources provided by outside databases/vendors is convenient and very user friendly
			</li>
			<li>Pros and cons of the system:<br />
			    Pros:<br />
			    -Wide range of resources are available in one location<br />
			    -Technology platform is standardized across a large organization instead of individual base-level information centers having to create their own unique platforms<br />
			    -Visually appealing home page with resources divided into useful subcategories (instead of just a standard listing of 88 resources which would be overwhelming)<br />
			    -Ability to directly link access to external resources after logging into the library website<br />
			    -Helpful that the eligibility to access is verified through a DoD ID number (listed on all users’ DoD ID cards) and birthdate method without the need to create a library specific account or userame/password.<br />
			    Cons:<br />
			    -Online catalog is difficult to encounter<br />
			    -Some resources require separate account establishment, and it is not clear in navigation panes if this is true or a single sign on is possible<br />
			    -Contact form is only for website/technical issues and users cannot ask reference questions
			</li>
			<li>Suggestions for improvement:<br /> 
			    -A link or direct search bar to the unified DoD-wide catalog should be centered on the homepage for users to quickly search for physical items held by DoD libraries. The rather convoluted method of requiring a search for physical libraries to find the link is not user friendly, especially when a single site hosts the entire catalog and catalogs are not physical library specific.<br />
			    -Links to other free online library information systems could be linked to highlight non-DoD resources available to the public.<br />
			    -Within the information blocks on individual digital resources, the information could include whether or not a separate account creation is required. This would assist users with quickly identifying which resources they can browse directly without creating accounts just to explore the resource content.
